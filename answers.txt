(a) Best practices violation:

1. Open-closed principle violation: The proposed fix for the implementation of encapsulation is implemented in my code.

2. Extensibility Violation: The previous code provided was hardcoded to a 3*3 grid. The fix to this violation has been implemented in my code that takes in custom inputs for rows and columns.

3. Testability Violation: The initial code provided didn’t facilitate unit testing. The fix to this violation has been implemented both by MVC refactoring and my code. MVC helped to a great extent by separating the model, view, and controller components for a better understanding. The test cases I’ve written for each of these separate components now facilitate isolated testing for better testability and readability.

(b) For the RowGameController, I’ve applied strategy design pattern.

(c) The observable in the model package is RowGameModel.
